# Web_Optimization_Project_Submission_Final
Critical Rendering Path
The Project specifications required a Pagespeed Score of 90 for mobile and desktop operating systems.

Frame Rate
Project specifications required optimizations in main.js to render webpage with consistent frame rate of 60fps while scrolling page.

To meet Project specifications required Gulp Build System, and changes within views/main.js.

Changes within main.js:
Properly structure right bracket semicolon ]; on list items
Reduce number of generated pizzas
Reduce size of pizzas
Render pizzas based on screen size
Extract redundant code to calculate pizza size and container once
Update function

Gulp Requirements for Build System
Installation of terminal emulator console, node. js software with npm package management system.
Initiation of npm with installation of Gulp generates a package.json file and gulpfile.js file.
Use of npm Gulp modules to process project files in development required the installation and saving of Gulp modules.
Modules then can be scripted and activated within gulpfile.js
Processed files are piped to a new file
